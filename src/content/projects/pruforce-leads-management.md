## Overview

Leads Management is the next phase of the [PRUForce Activity Management](/projects/pruforce-activity-management) module, designed to enhance how Prudential agents handle and distribute prospects efficiently. This feature streamlines lead tracking, assignment, and follow-ups to improve conversion rates and sales performance.

## Key Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Leads Management** â€“ Organize, track, and nurture leads from initial contact to conversion.
- ðŸ”€ **Leads Distribution** â€“ Smartly assign leads to the right agents based on predefined criteria.
- ðŸš€ **Performance Dashboard** â€“ Provides a clear overview of the agentâ€™s progress, performance metrics, and key insights.

## Challenges & solutions

### Codebase refactoring

_As the codebase grew, it became difficult to maintain and scale. The team had to refactor the codebase to improve maintainability and performance._

We refactored the codebase to use React hooks and make more components reusable. This allowed us to improve the codebase's maintainability and performance.

### Performance optimization

_The module suffers from slow initial load times and frequent re-renders._

We refactored the relevant sections to be loaded lazily, reducing the initial load times and improving performance.

## My Contributions

- Developed the leads management front-end
- Refactored the codebase to use React hooks
- Enhance features from activity management module to adapt with leads management's needs
- Enhance the performance of the leads management module
- Integrating internal libraries
- Assisted bi-weekly deployments

## Outcome

- Successfully implemented the leads management module, which later adopted by the higher regional app
- Refactored the codebase to improve maintainability and performance
