## Overview

Activity management is a module in PRUforce mobile application that facilitates insurance agent to manage their prospects.

## Challenges & solutions

### The first task I accomplished in my professional work: building a calendar component

_The team needed a customizeable calendar with following features: a monthly view, customizable style to match the PRUforce brand, a marker for a date, and a list of activities under the calendar on a selected date._

**Solution**: I used [full-calendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) library and added more customization to align with the PRUforce brand and product's requirements.
